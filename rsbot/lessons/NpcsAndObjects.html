                <h3>Npcs and GameObjects</h3>
                <p>
                    Npcs and GameObjects are used almost entirely the same, minus a few specific methods. They are both
                    accessed from their respective query class (Npcs and GameObjects) which both extend MobileIdQuery,
                    so their query usage is almost exactly the same as well. To reduce redundancy, they were merged into
                    one page.
                </p>
                <h3>Npcs</h3>
                <p>
                    Npcs are in-game representations of Non-Player Characters. All Npcs in the game can be accessed from
                    the Npc query class (<code>ctx.npcs</code>). This class has all of the same methods as a standard
                    query (see <span><a href="QueryIntro.html">Query Introduction</a></span>), and is used in the same
                    manner.
                </p>
                <h3>GameObjects</h3>
                <p>
                    GameObjects are an in-game representation of objects within the game, like bank booths (but
                    not bankers, since they are Npcs), chests, and doors. Like Npcs, the GameObject query class
                    (<code>ctx.objects</code>) extends MobileIdQuery, so it has the same methods.
                </p>
                <h3>IDs</h3>
                <p>
                    Npcs and GameObjects have a unique number that can be used to identify them. The vast majority of
                    the time, you will use IDs to find an Npc or GameObject. You can find an Npc's ID by going to View >
                    Npcs, and a GameObject's by going to View > Objects in the client. Their ID (as well as other
                    relative information) will be displayed over them. You can use the
                    <code>id(int...)</code> method in the query to filter based on ID.
                </p>
                <h3>Name</h3>
                <p>
                    MobileIdQuery inherits from Nameable, which provides a name to the entities via the
                    <code>name()</code> method. You can use the <code>name(String...)</code> method in the query to
                    filter based on name.
                </p>
                <h3>Location</h3>
                <p>
                    MobileIdQuery also inherits the <code>tile()</code> method from Locatable, and the
                    <code>at(Tile)</code> and <code>within(double)</code> methods from Locatable.Query.
                    You can use the <code>at(Tile)</code> method to filter the query results to filter results based
                    on the target's specific location, and the <code>within(double)</code> to filter results based on
                    distance from the local player to the target.
