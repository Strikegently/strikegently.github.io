                <p>
                    <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">IntelliJ</a> is a full-featured, and very powerful, Java
                    IDE. It is not required for RSBot development,
                    but it is an option that is available. The Community edition is free (gratis), open-source, and more
                    than enough for most developers, especially for those just seeking a tool for RSBot. After you
                    download and install it, you can continue through this tutorial for setting up IntelliJ for use with
                    RSBot.
