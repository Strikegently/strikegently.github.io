                <h3>Widgets and Components</h3>
                <p>
                    Widgets and Components are the in-game buttons and text displays. For instance, all of the tabs in
                    the Hud (Skills, Gear, Inventory, etc.) are all made up of Components.
                    As a general rule of thumb, a Component is contained within (or acts as as child to) a Widget.
                </p>
                <h3>Finding and Getting Components</h3>
                <p>
                    In the client, you can go to View > Widgets and the Widget Viewer tool will open. This tool allows
                    you to browse the currently valid widgets and components. When you select a widget, it will be
                    outlined with a yellow rectangle. As you go further down the tree
                    (Widget > Component > Component > ...), the identifying rectangle to update to the reflect the
                    currently selected component. Each component has a unique index value that is used to identify it.
                    You will use this index to fetch it for use.
                    Once you have the indices of the component you're looking for, you can use it with the widget API to
                    fetch its instance.
                <p>
                    To fetch a specific Widget instance, you can use the <code>widget(int index)</code> method:
                    <br>
                    <code>Widget widget = ctx.widgets.widget(0);</code>
                <p>
                    To fetch a specific Component, you use the <code>component(int widget, int component)</code> method:
                    <br>
                    <code>Component component = ctx.widgets.component(0, 1);</code>
                <p>
                    For a nested Component (component within a component), you can use the <code>component(int
                    component)</code> method in the Component class:
                    <br>
                    <code>Component component = ctx.widgets.component(0, 1).component(2);</code>
                </p>
                <h3>Chat API</h3>
                <p>
                    The API includes a set of helper functions specifically built for traversing the chat widgets.
                    It's used similarly to any other query. The <code>text(String...)</code> method will filter
                    currently available chat options by text. The <code>poll()</code> method will return a ChatOption
                    instance, which you can then <code>select(boolean)</code> to select. Passing <code>true</code> will
                    press the key associated with the option to activate it. Alternatively, passing <code>false</code>
                    will use the mouse to click the option.
                    <br>
                    <code>ChatOption chat = ctx.chat.select().text(String...)poll();</code>
                    <br>
                    <code>chat.select(true);</code>
                </p>
