                <p>
                    These tutorials assume that you have at least a basic understanding of Java and Object-Orientated
                    Programming concepts; these tutorials will be difficult to follow if you do not.

                <h3>Resources for Learning Java</h3>
                <p>
                    Java is one of the most widely used programming languages today. As such, there are innumerable
                    resources for learning it. The best option is to take a class at your school or local community
                    college. For American students, the AP Computer Science A course covers Java, general programming
                    practices, as well as many basic OOP concepts. There are also many MOOCs (Massive Open Online
                    Courses) that offer collegiate-level courses for free. The most notable are <a
