                <h3>PollingScript</h3>
                <p>
                    <span class="code">PollingScript</span> is the most basic type of script in RSBot. It offers a
                    method, <span class="code">poll()</span>, that loops
                    until the script is stopped. The main logic of your script will be placed inside the <span
                        class="code">poll()</span> method.
                    <br>
                    In addition to the <span class="code">poll()</span> method, PollingScript offers the methods <span
                        class="code">start()</span> and <span class="code">stop()</span>.
                    <br>
                    The <span class="code">start()</span> method is executed only once when the script is started. This
                    is the method that should
                    be used to set up your script (setting start XP, launching GUIs, etc).
                    <br>
                    The <span class="code">stop()</span> method is executed only once when the script is stopped.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <h3>Script Manifest</h3>
                <p>
                    The Script Manifest is where details of the script, like its name and description, are stored. For a
                    script to appear locally or on the SDN, it must have a manifest. There are 3 basic parts to the
                    manifest: the name, the description, and the properties.
                    <br><br>
                    The name flag is the name of the script. This is what the script is listed as on the SDN and the
                    script selector. The description flag is the description of the script. It shows below the name on
                    the SDN, and below the script selector in the client.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <h3>ClientContext</h3>
                <p>
                    <span class="code">ClientContext</span> will be discussed in the next chapter, but it needs to be
                    touched on briefly
                    here.
                    <br>
                    <span class="code">ClientContext</span> is the class that stores all of the API classes that
                    interface with the game. For
                    the <span class="code">PollingScript</span> parameterization, it signifies which type of context
                    your script will be using,
                    and is part of the identification process for the SDN to determine if your script is for OS or RS3.
